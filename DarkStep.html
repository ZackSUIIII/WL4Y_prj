    <h1>DarkStep</h1>
    <p>Dark Step is a leg-based Fighting Style that can be learned from the Dark Step Teacher at the cost of BeliIcon.png 150,000. It has an upgraded variant named Death Step, obtainable later in the game.
        While Dark Step is equipped, Enhancement appears on the player's legs instead of their arms while activated. This is entirely visual and provides no buffs.</p>
