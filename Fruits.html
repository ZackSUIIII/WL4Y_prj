    <h1>About Fruits</h1>
    <p>Ways to obtain blox fruits are:

        Dealing the highest damage in a Factory raid. (There used to be a bug where instead of granting the highest damage-dealing player a fruit, the person who deals the finishing blow to the core is instead rewarded with the fruit. This has been patched since 16/09/2022 (09/16/2022) - Update 17 Part 3 bug fixes) .
        Successfully defending Castle on the Sea from pirate NPCs, and defeating the Tanky NPC.
        Players can also defeat the Ship Raid to obtain a random fruit (there is a very low chance of getting one). This is also one of the Sea Events that can happen.
        Buying a fruit from the Blox Fruit Dealer or the Blox Fruits Dealer Cousin. The price of the fruit from the Blox Fruits Gacha depends on the players level. The prices of the Blox Fruit Dealer is always the same, no matter the level. The Blox Fruits Dealer has a stock, and the Blox Fruits Gacha gives the player a random physical fruit.
        You may also find random fruits across the map under trees (Small trees), although it is not recommended to look for fruits around the map without the Fruit Notifier gamepass as it is purely based on luck whether you will find one or not before it de-spawns.
        If the player instead wants to remove their fruit, they can pay BeliIcon.png 50,000 to an NPC called Remove Blox Fruit (It is not recommended to do), located at the Prison, or at the top of the Castle on the Sea.        
        Falling into a body of water while having a Blox Fruit (except for Ice, Human: Buddha V2, and Magma V2, which gives the ability to walk on water, buddha doesn't walk on it but it's hit box is big enough to avoid it) power will cause the player to take a lot of damage in a short span of time (Sand users also take 2x damage from water due to water hardening sand). This goes for every fruit in the game. However, being a member of the Fish race decreases damage from water, and even completely nullifies it if the player upgrades the race to V2 or V3.       
        Later on in the game, the player will also be able to awaken their Blox Fruit, boosting its abilities and damage. This can also add an additional move onto certain fruits such as Human: Buddha, Dark, Ice, Flame, etc. Sometimes even adding a m1, or click/tap attack as well.
