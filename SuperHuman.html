    <h1>SuperHuman</h1>
    <p>Superhuman is a fighting style that costs $3,000,000, and specializes in speed, stuns and knockback. It's great in PvP and is technically an upgraded fighting style, as you need 300 mastery on four other fighting styles in order to obtain it. It's sold by the Martial Arts Master. It can be upgraded into a stronger version of itself, called Godhuman.</p>
