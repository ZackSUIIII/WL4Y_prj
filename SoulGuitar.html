    <h1>Soul Guitar</h1>
    <p>The Soul Guitar is a Mythical gun, added in Update 17, Part 3. It is a gun like none other, shooting musical notes with the power of the undead.
        To obtain the Soul Guitar, the player must be Lv. 2300+, after which they can complete the Soul Guitar Puzzle, that involves the full moon and some materials that are 500 Bones, 250 Ectoplasms and 1 Dark Fragment.       
        It is very good on raids because of its life regeneration.        
        Talk to the Blacksmith in order to perform Upgrading.</p>
