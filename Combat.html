    <h1>Combat</h1>
    <p>Combat is the first and the starting fighting style that the player gets upon first joining. It's the weakest and most common fighting style in the game, seeing as every player has had it once. But, at the same time, it's also one of the rarest you can find because almost every player just switches to another fighting style during their playthrough. Otherwise, people like to keep combat and max its mastery for fun.
        Even so, it's recommended to just buy another fighting style such as Dark Step, as Combat is generally weak. Although keep in mind, if switched to another fighting style, there is no way to obtain it again as there is no Fighting style trainer that can re-teach it.        
        A technically (in some way) upgraded version of this fighting style is Superhuman.</p>
