    <h1>DeathStep</h1>
    <p>Death Step is a leg-based fighting style added in Update 13 that can be learnt from Phoeyu, the Reformed. It is the upgraded variant of Dark Step, making it more powerful in every aspect.
        While Death Step is equipped, Enhancement stages are based on the player's legs instead of their arms while activated. This is entirely visual and provides no buffs apart from regular Enhancement buffs.</p>
