    <h1>Spin</h1>
    <p>The Spin Blox Fruit is a common Natural-type Fruit that costs $7,500, or $75, from the Blox Fruit Dealer. It can also be obtained by a relatively high chance from the Blox Fruits Dealer Cousin. It was added in Update 15. This fruit has a 100% chance of being in stock, and a 12% chance of spawning in-game. It allows the user to spin, used for flight.

        This fruit is used by the Marine Rear Admiral NPCs.
        
        The money cost for Spin prior to update 17.3 was $180,000 or R$380 from the Blox Fruit Dealer.</p>
