    <h1>Smoke</h1>
    <p>The Smoke Fruit is a Elemental-type Blox Fruit that costs $100,000 or $250 from Blox Fruit Dealer. It has a random chance to be obtained from the Blox Fruits Dealer Cousin. The Smoke fruit has a 25% chance of being in stock, and a 13% chance of spawning in-game.

        It is the lowest tier of Elemental-type Blox Fruits, but it's actually not the worst as the [F] move can do infinite damage.
        
        It is also one of the two Elemental-type fruits that does not have an awakening, the other being Blizzard.
        
        Note: The Smoke Admiral Boss also uses this fruit. He has immunity to swords, guns, and melee attacks. This can be bypassed by having Enhancement activated.</p>
