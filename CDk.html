    <h1>Cursed Dual Katana</h1>
    <p>Cursed Dual Katana was added as a new mythical sword added in Update 17.3. This is the successor of Yama and Tushita. This sword is one of the highest damaging swords in the game. Capable of even doing more damage than a non-upgraded Saber V2. This sword is dangerously OP (Overpowered) if used correctly in PvP, and is also excellent for grinding as well.</p>
