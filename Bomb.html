    <h1>Bomb</h1>
    <p>Bomb is a Natural-type Blox Fruit that costs $80,000, or $220 from the Blox Fruit Dealer.
        Bomb is also used by the Third Sea boss Stone, although he uses the old version.
        
        In update 17.3, Bomb is one of the fruits that got a revamp. Some people joked that it is one of the "best fruits" despite being one of the worst in Update 17.2.
        
        The money cost of bomb in Update 17.3 is $80,000, or R$220 from the Blox Fruit Dealer but in update 17.2 the fruit price was $5,000, or R$50 from the Blox Fruit Dealer
