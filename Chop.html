    <h1>Chop</h1>
    <p>Chop is a Natural-type Blox Fruit. It costs $30,000, or $100, from the Blox Fruit Dealer. It was added in Update 1. This fruit has a 35% chance of being in stock, and a 15% chance of spawning in-game.
        What separates Chop from other Natural-type Blox Fruits is that users of it cannot be harmed by Swords, even with Enhancement, although you can still be damaged by both the Lightâ€™s sword and Ice's trident even with Enhancement off or on. This is because they both count as part of the Elemental fruit, which basically means they are the same as a normal Blox Fruit attack.        
        [NOTE: BOSSES DO NOT GET AFFECTED BY THIS PASSIVE MEANING THEY CAN STILL HIT YOU IF THEY USE SWORDS]        
        This fruit is used by Bobby on Pirate Village, you can actually use Swords when going up against him, but he has a 1/4 chance to dodge sword attacks.        
        This fruit is also good for early game grinding, as early NPCs like Pirates and Brutes use swords.</p>
