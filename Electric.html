    <h1>Electric</h1>
    <p>Electric can be bought on the first level of Skylands from the Mad Scientist for $500,000.
        The Mad Scientist is hiding behind one of the rocks around the bottom of the Sky Islands. They resemble a "Humanoid Tiger."                
        This Fighting style can be upgraded to Electric Claw, upon reaching 400 mastery and gaining access to Third Sea.</p>
